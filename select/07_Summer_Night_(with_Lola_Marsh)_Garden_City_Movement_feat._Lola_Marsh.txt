Summer night

Bright eyes, tell me why
They're playing us like toys?
Break your silence for
We gotta make some noise
We gotta shout out loud
We're gonna start a fight

Dark scam, tell me how
They're changing all the rules
Telling, selling us
Their lies, we are no fools
We gotta shout out loud
We must start a fight

And if they're gonna chase me
No work, but I'm not lazy
They're never gonna get my peace of mind
We're fine, don't need no guidance
To shake them off their blindness
Is that our way to go? Soon we'll find

And if you're cold and aching
Let's ride the wind of the summer night
Of the summer night
We're growing strong and steady
They'll never win, we gotta fight
We gotta fight

Cold and aching
Wind of the summer night
Cold and aching
Wind of the summer night

So don't you think it's time to go?
Gotta wait for the smoke to clear
Golden fools are rushing in
To roll us up in fear
We gotta shout out loud
We must start a fight

And if they're gonna chase me
No work, but I'm not lazy
They'll never gonna get my peace of mind
We're fine, don't need no guidance
To shake them off their blindness
Is that our way to go? Soon we'll find

And if you're cold and aching
Let's ride the wind of the summer night
Of the summer night
We're growing strong and steady
They'll never win, we gotta fight
We gotta fight

And if you're cold and aching
Let's ride the wind of the summer night
Of the summer night
We're growing strong and steady
They'll never win, we gotta fight
We must start a fight

Cold and aching
Wind of the summer night
Cold and aching
Wind of the summer night
Cold and aching

And if you're cold and aching
Let's ride the wind of the summer night
Of the summer night
We're growing strong and steady
They'll never win, we gotta fight
We must start a fight

Cold and aching
Wind of the summer night
