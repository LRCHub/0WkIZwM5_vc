Heard you were coming back
Been hanging around for so long
A militant mothers, a militant brothers
A militant marsh mellow field
Loosen the tourniquet
Long way to go for so long
An angry professor, misguided confessor
Of militant marsh mellow field
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me out of my mind?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me out of my mind?
Valedictorian
Living the words for so long
I love you forever, I curse the bad weather
In militant marsh mellow fields
Its raining in storyland
Stuck in the pages so long
Attracted a loser, a practiced confuser
A militant marsh mellow field
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me out of my mind?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me?
Oh won't you take me out of my mind?
New resolution
Forever lasting so long
Got over inflated, I no longer waited
In militant marsh mellow fields
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me
Oh won't you take me out of my mind
